# Bank Churner Predictor App

This project contains two parts:

1. The data analytics part where we work directly on the data to try and clean the data and prepare it to finally extract meaningful insights which will help us in the end create our ML model and export it.
2. The second part consists of implementing and using the ML model, that is done by creating a simple interface with Streamlit then using different criteria predict whether or not the user is going to churn or not
